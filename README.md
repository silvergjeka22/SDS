# Security Disclaimer Ontology (SDS)

## Introduction
The **Security Disclaimer Ontology (SDS)** is designed to model the various elements involved in disclaiming security responsibilities. It provides a structured representation of key concepts related to security disclaimers, including risks, liabilities, legal considerations, and mitigations.

## Classes and Subclasses
The ontology consists of various classes and subclasses, organized into key areas relevant to security disclaiming:

### Disclaimer
- **LegalDisclaimer**: Specifies legal limitations and responsibilities regarding security aspects.
- **TechnicalDisclaimer**: Addresses technical limitations and security assurances.
- **PrivacyDisclaimer**: Involves disclaimers related to data privacy and personal information.

### Risk
- **SecurityRisk**: Risks related to unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches.
- **OperationalRisk**: Risks arising from internal processes and systems.
- **ComplianceRisk**: Risks related to failure in meeting legal security requirements.
- **ReputationalRisk**: Risks affecting the credibility of an entity due to security failures.

### Threat
- **CyberThreat**: Malicious attacks, hacking, phishing, and malware.
- **HumanThreat**: Employee errors, insider threats, and social engineering.
- **PhysicalThreat**: Theft, vandalism, and unauthorized access to physical assets.

### Vulnerability
- **ApplicationVulnerability**: Software-related weaknesses that may be exploited.
- **NetworkVulnerability**: Infrastructure flaws leading to unauthorized access.
- **ComplianceVulnerability**: Weaknesses in meeting security regulations and standards.

### Impact
- **FinancialImpact**: The cost implications of a security failure.
- **ReputationalImpact**: The damage to an organization's credibility.
- **LegalImpact**: Potential legal consequences of security disclaimers.

### Control
- **PreventiveControl**: Measures to prevent security risks.
- **DetectiveControl**: Monitoring and alert mechanisms for security threats.
- **CorrectiveControl**: Actions taken to mitigate security failures.

### Incident
- **DataBreachIncident**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **SystemFailureIncident**: Breakdown of critical security infrastructure.
- **ComplianceIncident**: Legal violations related to security.

## Object Properties
The ontology defines relationships between the classes:
- `hasThreat`: Links risks to relevant threats.
- `hasVulnerability`: Associates risks with vulnerabilities.
- `affectsAsset`: Identifies assets impacted by security risks.
- `hasImpact`: Specifies the consequences of a risk.
- `isMitigatedBy`: Links risks to controls.
- `resultsInIncident`: Describes the incidents caused by risks.

## Example Usage
```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:SDS="http://www.semanticweb.org/silvergjeka/ontologies/2025/2/SDS#">
    <SDS:Disclaimer rdf:about="#ExampleDisclaimer">
        <SDS:hasStatement>"This software is provided as-is with no security guarantees."</SDS:hasStatement>
    </SDS:Disclaimer>

```

## Using the Ontology
1. **Modeling Security Disclaimers**: Define legal, technical, and privacy disclaimers.
2. **Assessing Risks**: Identify potential security risks and their sources.
3. **Linking Threats and Vulnerabilities**: Establish relationships between threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.
4. **Implementing Controls**: Associate controls with risks for mitigation.
5. **Incident Management**: Track security-related incidents and their impact.
